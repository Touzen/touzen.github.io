I'm a software engineer from Sweden working as a consultant for the awesome company [Netlight](https://www.netlight.com)!

### Really? Is that all you are?

No, I'm also passionate about politics and have a background as an elected official for the Social Democrats. While most of my spare-time used to be consumed by this constructive urge to work for a better society, now all that energy has been directed towards ranting. :)

A lot of time is also spent geeking out about languages. The bulk of my projects center around NLP, and that was also the "major" of my master's programme (data science and language technology). I'm also working on improving my Persian language skills, which is my second mother tongue after Swedish.
