I'm a [PhD student](https://vakili.science) at the [Department of Computer and Systems Sciences](https://dsv.su.se) at [Stockholm University](https://www.su.se) where I am researching natural language processing and privacy preservation. I have previously worked in the software industry as mostly as a back-end developer and as a data engineer.

# Really? Is that all you are?

No, I'm also passionate about politics and have a background as an elected official for the Social Democrats. While most of my spare-time used to be consumed by this constructive urge to work for a better society, now all that energy has been directed towards ranting. :)

A lot of time is also spent geeking out about languages. My passion for natural languages goes beyond processing them using computers, I also like them irl! I'm always working on improving my Persian language skills (my second mother tongue after Swedish) or oversharing "fun facts" about phonetics and other exciting language features.
